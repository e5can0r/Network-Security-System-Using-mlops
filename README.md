# üîê MLOps Solution for Network Security in Malicious URL Detection

This is a comprehensive end-to-end MLOps project designed to detect and classify malicious URLs. It ensures user safety by identifying harmful links using machine learning, with a full pipeline for data ingestion, model training, deployment, and monitoring.

The app supports:

    Batch predictions via an interactive web interface (Streamlit) powered by a backend API (FastAPI)

---

## üìå Introduction

Malicious URLs are frequently used in phishing, malware, and social engineering attacks. This project applies machine learning to analyze and classify URLs as **safe (0)** or **malicious (1)**.

Our pipeline automates:
- Storing raw data into MongoDB
- Preprocessing and transforming features
- Training and versioning the ML model
- Deploying predictions via APIs and UI
- Hosting on cloud (Railway)

## üß© Components

### üñ•Ô∏è Frontend (Streamlit)
The Streamlit app provides an intuitive interface for users to perform **batch predictions** of URLs categorized as **Malicious**, **Suspicious**, or **Safe**.

<!-- ![Streamlit UI](assets/frontend.png) -->
![Prediction Output](assets/frontend_pred.png)

### üß† Backend (FastAPI)
FastAPI handles the model's operations, such as training and batch prediction:

- **/train Route**: Triggers the training of the model using stored data in the database. This can be invoked manually via FastAPI's `/docs` interface.
  
- **/predict Route**: Accepts a CSV file containing multiple URLs and returns a CSV with predictions for each entry.

- Saved the **transformation pipeline** as a reusable artifact (`.pkl` file).

### ü§ñ Model Training & Evaluation
- Trained using **RandomForestClassifier**.
- Tuned hyperparameters via **GridSearchCV** for optimal results.
- Evaluated using metrics like **Precision, Recall, and F1-score**.
- Experiment tracking managed with **MLflow**, hosted via **DagsHub**.
